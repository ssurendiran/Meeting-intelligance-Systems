[00:00:00] Alex: Let's kick off the product sync. We need to decide on the Q2 launch date.
[00:00:12] Sam: I'd suggest we target June 15. Engineering can have the beta ready by then.
[00:00:25] Jordan: Marketing needs at least three weeks for the campaign. Can we do June 22?
[00:00:38] Alex: June 22 works. Sam, can you confirm with engineering?
[00:00:45] Sam: Yes. I'll send an update by Friday.
[00:00:52] Jordan: Action item for me: I'll draft the launch announcement by next week.
[00:01:05] Alex: Thanks. Any risks or open questions?
[00:01:12] Sam: One thing — we're waiting on the design review. If it slips, we might need to push to end of June.
[00:01:28] Alex: Noted. Jordan, can you chase design and add that to the risks?
[00:01:35] Jordan: Will do. That's it from my side.
[00:01:42] Alex: Same here. Next sync same time next week. Thanks everyone.
