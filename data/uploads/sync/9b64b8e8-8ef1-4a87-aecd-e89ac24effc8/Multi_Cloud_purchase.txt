[00:00:00] Suren: Good morning, everyone. Let's get started with the discussion on the Multi Cloud purchase. 

[00:00:10] Moni: Good morning, Suren. I think we need to outline our objectives for this purchase first.

[00:00:20] Lavanya: Agreed, Moni. What are the key goals we want to achieve with the Multi Cloud solution?

[00:00:30] Deepa: I believe flexibility and scalability should be our top priorities.

[00:00:40] Suren: Yes, flexibility is crucial. What about cost-effectiveness?

[00:00:50] Moni: Cost is definitely a factor. We should also consider the vendor's reliability.

[00:01:00] Lavanya: Right. We need to assess the different vendors available in the market.

[00:01:10] Deepa: Should we create a comparison matrix for the vendors?

[00:01:20] Suren: That sounds like a good idea, Deepa. Let's assign that task.

[00:01:30] Moni: I can take the lead on the comparison matrix. 

[00:01:40] Lavanya: Great! What criteria should we include in the matrix?

[00:01:50] Deepa: Performance metrics, pricing, support services, and security features.

[00:02:00] Suren: Excellent. We should also look at integration capabilities with our existing systems.

[00:02:10] Moni: I can add that to the matrix as well.

[00:02:20] Lavanya: What timeline are we looking at for this purchase?

[00:02:30] Deepa: I suggest we aim for a decision within the next month.

[00:02:40] Suren: That gives us enough time to evaluate the options thoroughly.

[00:02:50] Moni: Should we schedule follow-up meetings to track our progress?

[00:03:00] Lavanya: Yes, weekly check-ins would help keep everyone aligned.

[00:03:10] Deepa: I can set up a recurring meeting for us.

[00:03:20] Suren: Perfect. Let's also document any risks we identify during this process.

[00:03:30] Moni: Good point. What risks are we currently aware of?

[00:03:40] Lavanya: Vendor lock-in is a significant concern in multi-cloud environments.

[00:03:50] Deepa: Also, potential data transfer costs could impact our budget.

[00:04:00] Suren: We should factor those into our decision-making process.

[00:04:10] Moni: Agreed. What about compliance and regulatory issues?

[00:04:20] Lavanya: That’s another critical area we need to investigate.

[00:04:30] Deepa: Should we involve our legal team in this discussion?

[00:04:40] Suren: Yes, I think it would be wise to consult them early on.

[00:04:50] Moni: I can reach out to the legal team to get their input.

[00:05:00] Lavanya: What about the training for our team on the new system?

[00:05:10] Deepa: We should plan for training sessions post-purchase.

[00:05:20] Suren: That’s a good idea. It will ensure a smooth transition.

[00:05:30] Moni: Should we also consider a pilot program before full deployment?

[00:05:40] Lavanya: Yes, a pilot would help us identify any issues early on.

[00:05:50] Deepa: I can outline a proposal for the pilot program.

[00:06:00] Suren: Let’s make that part of our action items.

[00:06:10] Moni: What about customer support from the vendors?

[00:06:20] Lavanya: We should evaluate their support response times and availability.

[00:06:30] Deepa: I can include that in the comparison matrix as well.

[00:06:40] Suren: Excellent. Are there any other points we need to cover today?

[00:06:50] Moni: I think we’ve covered the main aspects.

[00:07:00] Lavanya: Let’s recap our action items before we wrap up.

[00:07:10] Deepa: I’ll document the risks we discussed today.

[00:07:20] Suren: Moni will lead the comparison matrix.

[00:07:30] Moni: I’ll also reach out to the legal team.

[00:07:40] Lavanya: I’ll work on the training plan.

[00:07:50] Deepa: And I’ll draft the pilot program proposal.

[00:08:00] Suren: Great! Let’s aim to have these tasks completed by next week.

[00:08:10] Moni: Sounds good. Looking forward to our next meeting.

[00:08:20] Lavanya: Me too! Let’s make this purchase a success.

[00:08:30] Deepa: Agreed. Thank you, everyone. 

[00:08:40] Suren: Thank you all for your contributions today. Meeting adjourned.
